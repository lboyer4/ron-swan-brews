### Description
This project was my Turing Mod3 final project. Ron Swan Brews is crafted to allow a user to search, view, and favorite Colorado breweries. All data was brought in via pre-made API. This app gives the user the whimsical feature of a randomized Ron Swanson quote while allowing them to search for a brewery in the Colorado area. 
It was required to use and include React, Redux, an API, and testing.

### Learning Goals

The main goal of this project was to successfully implement a variety of technologies including: React, Redux, Router, and Asynchronous javaScript. 

My personal learning goal is to improve my testing skills in all of these areas.
